Prehistory: 
I wrote a similar application with my ex-best friend.
Unfortunately, almost all joint projects were lost (this one too).
But I remember every application I wrote with you,
and this is my attempt to recreate our creation.

Thank you for joint development.
Just something to remember us by.
