Prehistory: 
I wrote a similar application with my ex-best friend.
Unfortunately, almost all joint projects were lost (this one too).
But I remember every application I wrote with you,
and this is my attempt to recreate our masterpiece.

Thank you for the joint development, support and love.
Just something to remember us by.
